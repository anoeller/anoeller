<h1> Welcome!  My name is Alessi Reiter </h1>

<h2> A little bit about me: </h2>
<p> I earned my BS in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science from Christopher Newport University (CNU) in December 2021.  Since then I have been exploring different fields of interest to find what I am truly passionate about - software development!  Front-end development has specifically peaked my interest as it incorporates creativity and problem-solving all in one. I am actively looking for entry-level positions as I am super excited to get started in software development!</p>
